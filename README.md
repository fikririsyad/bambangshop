## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
1. I think we don't need an interface, since we only have one type of Subscriber. For now, I think single model struct is enough.
1. Based on my understanding, Vec is sufficient but DashMap is better for this case because we can make a key-value pair from id and url to make it more efficient.
1. Based on my understanding, I think DashMap is still needed because it is thread-safe, so it can be accessed by multiple threads. We can complement it by implementing Singleton pattern to make sure that there's only one SUBSCRIBERS.

#### Reflection Publisher-2
1. I think we need to separate it to adhere to Single Responsibility Principle, seeing that in MVC, Model has too many responsibilities. By separating it, Service will handle the business logic, Repository will handle data storage operations, and now Model will only be used as the structure of the data.
1. I think the code will be very messy considering that Model will handle all data-related operations and it leads to code that is hard to read. Additionally, Model will hold too many responsibilities making it more complex and harder to maintain.
1. I haven't explored much about Postman, but from the file that was given in this tutorial, I find it to be very useful because we can save API requests for testing our application and see if the responses are correct. It makes the process of checking our code functionality quite fast.

#### Reflection Publisher-3
1. In this tutorial, we use Push model Observer Pattern where the publisher will push notifications to their subscriber when an update occurs.
1. The advantage of Pull model is that it's more efficient and flexible because the subscribers will only get the information when they need it. The disadvantage of Pull model is it will increase the code complexity and overhead.
1. If we didn't use multi-threading, the process of giving notifications to subscribers would be significantly slower considering that the publisher has to notify the subscribers one by one. Therefore, we can't give the notification simultaneously to all subscribers.
